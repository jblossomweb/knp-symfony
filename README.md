Symfony 3 Demo
========================
I needed to learn Symfony to support an existing system.

Follows track from KNP University:
[http://knpuniversity.com/tracks/symfony][1]

With some changes:

* substituted Jade (aka Pug) as the templating engine

To install, run locally:

* install deps with composer:
```bash
composer install
```

* run server without apache/nginx on PHP >5.5:
```bash
php bin/console server:run
```

* point your browser to:
```bash
http://localhost:8000/genus/
```

Enjoy
